The project is quite easy to setup.
Simply clone the src folder to your local Python environment, install the libraries, and you should be good to go.
The code should be pretty well commented but feel free to open an issue if you have some trouble understanding something (you'd need a basic level in Python though).
Libraries to install:
- numpy
- openpyxl
- pandas
- tkinter
- tkcalendar
- tkintermapview
- datefinder

Compiling the code can be done using PyInstaller. Simply execute `pyinstaller --onefile main.py` at the root of the "src" folder.
Do not forget to add the "db" folder (with its content at the same location of your main.exe output! Otherwise the program will not be able to find the database. Please see the "out" folder of the project for an example.
Note: I had to execute `pip install pyinstaller tkcalendar` and `pip install pyinstaller datefinder` in my terminal for the libraries to be usable, including them in the main.spec hiddenimports wasn't enough for some reason.

Structure of the project:
- main.py is the central file, generating the main menu and coordinating the other files.
- input.py is the file handling the data specification feature (user uploads file and tells the program which data to take into account, basically).
- database.py is the file handling the insertion of the data in the database. The data was specified during the input.py process.
- selection.py is the file handling the selection of data from the database aiming to use it for the analyze.
- analyze.py is the file handling the analyze of the data selected during the select.py process, based on specific requests made by the user.
